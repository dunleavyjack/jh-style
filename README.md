# JH Style (A Mini Web App)

![]('../../src/assets/jh-style.gif)

This project was a quick and dirty React app to help my gf choose an outfit for the night. It's not anything more than that!

She drew three potential outfits and I built a single page web app to randomize her outfits for destiny to decide.

It was built with: [React](https://react.dev/) and hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
